Package groups together code
use import to access code from different packages

Create a project under the src folder found in C:\Users\Joshua Paul\go
in the project folder, create a go.mod file to act as a package directory
EX: For this project the mod is monkey
The package we want to install is called token so:
import "monkey/token"

 go build: as a check that the packages can be built (along with their dependencies) 
 go install: also (permanently) installs the results in the proper folders of your $GOPATH.

Byte and string are similar except a string is immutable while a byte can add more bytes at the end up to its capacity
